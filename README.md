# Tesseract-OCR-iOS
just click on TextRecognition3.xcworkspace to be opend in Xcode
Note: Bitcode should be NO for project and target
there are some samples of buisness cards in "Assets.xcassets"
in "Main.storyboard" I have added a text view for showing the texts (the outocme of OCR)
in ViewController.swift you could change the name of file in line 19 and run the app
you would get the text in textView.
